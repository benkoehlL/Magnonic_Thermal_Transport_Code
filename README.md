# Magnonic_Thermal_Transport_Code
These are the programs I used in my PhD thesis to calculate the effects of external fields on the thermal transport by magnetic excitations (magnons).

## Dispersion
This is a simple collection of programs that allows to calculate the dispersion on specific paths.

## Electric field heterostructure
Here, I implemented linear spin wave theory in real-space and applied it to a system where an electric field induces a controllable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

## Selfenergy
This set of programs calculates the selfenergy corrections of the magnon system  and the thermal conductivity as a function of a magnetic field.

## stripey
These programs are an alternative to the real-space spin wave theory in "Electric field heterostructure". They take the existing translational invariance in one direction into account and only handle the direction with broken translational invariance differently.
